                                            of objects, DataSourceRef allows any non-core
                                            object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                            objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                            values (dropping them), DataSourceRef
                                            preserves all values, and generates an
                                            error if a disallowed value is specified.
